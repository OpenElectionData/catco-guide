Having clear criteria to measure your success will allow you to know if your communications plan is working and achieving your goals -- or if it’s not performing as you had hoped, and you need to revisit and adjust your strategies and tactics. You’ll need to know what you’re measuring and ideally you’ll be collecting data frequently enough to see problems early and adjust before it’s too late or too hard. 

You’re not starting totally from scratch, as the “M” in your SMART goals is “measurable.” If you’ve written your goals with measurability in mind, then you’ll have some idea of what metrics you need to collect and use as benchmarks on your way to your goal. 

During your planning process, think about what metrics are meaningful and matter to your work. You don’t want to be in a position where you are tracking the metrics that are easiest to track but aren’t a real measure of the success of your program. It can also be difficult or impossible in some cases to gather data from the past, so you want to have a clear understanding of what is relevant before you begin.
