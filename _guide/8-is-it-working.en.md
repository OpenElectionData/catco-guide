Having clear criteria to measure your success will allow you to know if your communications plan is working and achieving your goals -- or if it’s not performing as you had hoped, and you need to revisit and adjust your strategies and tactics. You’ll need to know what you’re measuring and ideally you’ll be collecting data frequently enough to see problems early and adjust before it’s too late or too hard.

You’re not starting totally from scratch, as the “M” in your SMART goals is “measurable.” If you’ve written your goals with measurability in mind, then you’ll have some idea of what metrics you need to collect and use as benchmarks on your way to your goal.

During your planning process, think about what metrics are meaningful and matter to your work. You don’t want to be in a position where you are tracking the metrics that are easiest to track but aren’t a real measure of the success of your program. It can also be difficult or impossible in some cases to gather data from the past, so you want to have a clear understanding of what is relevant before you begin.

## Reach vs Engagement

There are two broad ways to measure your communications: reach and engagement. 

Reach looks at how many people saw your content. It does not distinguish between active and passive consumption -- if a person sees your TV ad, receives your email, or scrolls past your content in their newsfeed, it will count toward your reach. Reach can be a useful metric if you are trying to saturate a market, strengthen your brand, or raise awareness of an issue -- just creating a constant presence with a certain audience, even if they are passively consuming your information, can sometimes be an effective strategy. 

Engagement measures whether someone took action with your content in some way. On social media, this might include leaving a comment, sharing your post, or clicking through to join your email list or sign up to volunteer. In an email, it might include opening the email, clicking through your call to action, forwarding the email to a friend, or replying to your email. With a text message, it might mean they reply or show up to the protest you are informing them about. 

Engagement numbers will be lower than reach, but the interactions will be deeper and the audience more heavily invested in your mission and its success. Think carefully about whether you need a smaller-but-active or a larger-but-passive audience to achieve your goals before deciding whether you will emphasize reach or engagement.

You can also measure both -- and indeed, they are not necessarily disconnected. To achieve the engagement numbers you want, you may need to reach more people. But you should be clear about what metrics are relevant to achieving your goals and prioritize those.

In Nicaragua, the election observation coalition [Panorama Electoral](https://www.panoramaelectoral.org/) was measuring success purely in reach, rather than the discussion and debate being generated.

However, in order to achieve their goals of fostering dialogue and increasing participation, the group shifted to collecting metrics on engagement and interaction, prompting them to see the need for a community manager to moderate the dialogue on their social media feeds.

## Common Analytics and Metrics Available

A number of digital platforms have built-in analytics that you can access for free (or included in the price) that are very powerful when used well.

## Email Analytics

Any mass emailer you use should provide you with basic analytic data you can use to refine your email strategy.

* Open rate: This is the rate at which people open your email. A healthy and active email list will have around a 20 percent open rate for any given email sent.
* Click-through rate: This is the rate at which people click on whatever links you put in your emails. For emails with a clear call to action, you should expect a click-through rate of 20 percent. Most mass emailers will also show you which links were clicked on the most, so you can learn whether placing your call to action at the top or bottom of your email is more effective, or whether there is one link people were more interested in than others, for example.
* Unsubscribe rate: This is the rate at which people unsubscribe from any given email. A normal unsubscribe rate is less than 1 percent per send. If you see a sudden spike in unsubscribes, you should figure out whether you’re emailing too often or if your language, tone, or content are alienating your audience.

## Google Analytics

Google Analytics tracks all your web traffic and the behavior of the people who visit your website. Once you have a Gmail address, you can use it to open an account at [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com/). There you can get a small bit of code that you place into your website (follow Google’s instructions for how to do this), and after that you will be able to track all your web traffic in real time and over time. Be sure to install Google Analytics on your websites from the very beginning -- the analytics cannot collect data on your site from a time before it was installed.

There is a lot of information available to you in analytics, and you should spend some time exploring it to see what’s available. Most of it was designed to help business websites maximize their customers’ experience, but there is still a lot of useful information for civic groups.

* **Audience:** You can learn about the visitors to your website through the audience features. How many unique visitors did you get and how often do they come back? How long do they stay on the site and how many pages do they view in a visit? What are the demographics of your audience and what are their interests? If you were hoping for deep engagement on your website from young men ages 16-26, but your analytics reveal that your primary audience is older women ages 60-75 and they are only staying on the site for an average of 8 seconds, then you may need re-evaluate either the content of your website or the ways that you are promoting it (or both).


* **Devices and browsers:** Part of the audience information includes what browsers and devices they are using to access your site. Be sure that your site is optimized to look its best on the most popular devices and browsers your audience is using.


* **Behavior:** You can learn about how people actually use your site from the behavior features. You can see what content is most popular and how long people spend engaging with each page. You can also see the most common site behavior flows -- what pages do people start on and how do they travel through the site? Are they finding the information you most want them to find? Are they engaging deeply with your site or spending only a few seconds on it? Is the path through the site the one you had envisioned? If not, do you need to change your menu or page configuration to ensure that people are seeing the information you want them to prioritize? Use the behavior information to maximize the impact of your content and refine your site to ensure that your audience has an easy time finding the information it needs.
* **Acquisition:** You can learn a lot about how your audience found your site from the acquisition features. You can find how many people found you through organic search and the search terms they used to do so. You can also see what websites account for your web referrals -- if they are coming from your social media posts, news articles, other referring websites, etc. If your social media referrals are low but your organic search rates are high, you might want to spend more time creating content that performs well based on what people are searching for, rather than creating more posts for social media that refer back to your website, for example. If you are paying for site promotion you can also link your Google AdWords account to your Analytics account and monitor it in this section.
* You can create sophisticated searches and reports by combining this data. Click on “add a segment” to any report screen to add additional data points. For example, if you want to see how young men ages 16-26 are finding your site versus older women ages 60-75, you can add a demographics segment to your channels analytics screen and find the breakdown. They may have totally different referrals, which you can then refine and cater to more effectively.
* You can also compare site performance over time with the date range feature. You can look at your analytics over any period of time you choose, and you can also overlay that over any comparable period of time by clicking “compare to.” This can help you analyze trends over time in the data.
