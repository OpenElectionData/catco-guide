Having clear criteria to measure your success will allow you to know if your communications plan is working and achieving your goals -- or if it’s not performing as you had hoped, and you need to revisit and adjust your strategies and tactics. You’ll need to know what you’re measuring and ideally you’ll be collecting data frequently enough to see problems early and adjust before it’s too late or too hard.

You’re not starting totally from scratch, as the “M” in your SMART goals is “measurable.” If you’ve written your goals with measurability in mind, then you’ll have some idea of what metrics you need to collect and use as benchmarks on your way to your goal.

During your planning process, think about what metrics are meaningful and matter to your work. You don’t want to be in a position where you are tracking the metrics that are easiest to track but aren’t a real measure of the success of your program. It can also be difficult or impossible in some cases to gather data from the past, so you want to have a clear understanding of what is relevant before you begin.

## Reach vs Engagement

There are two broad ways to measure your communications: reach and engagement. 

Reach looks at how many people saw your content. It does not distinguish between active and passive consumption -- if a person sees your TV ad, receives your email, or scrolls past your content in their newsfeed, it will count toward your reach. Reach can be a useful metric if you are trying to saturate a market, strengthen your brand, or raise awareness of an issue -- just creating a constant presence with a certain audience, even if they are passively consuming your information, can sometimes be an effective strategy. 

Engagement measures whether someone took action with your content in some way. On social media, this might include leaving a comment, sharing your post, or clicking through to join your email list or sign up to volunteer. In an email, it might include opening the email, clicking through your call to action, forwarding the email to a friend, or replying to your email. With a text message, it might mean they reply or show up to the protest you are informing them about. 

Engagement numbers will be lower than reach, but the interactions will be deeper and the audience more heavily invested in your mission and its success. Think carefully about whether you need a smaller-but-active or a larger-but-passive audience to achieve your goals before deciding whether you will emphasize reach or engagement.

You can also measure both -- and indeed, they are not necessarily disconnected. To achieve the engagement numbers you want, you may need to reach more people. But you should be clear about what metrics are relevant to achieving your goals and prioritize those.

In Nicaragua, the election observation coalition [Panorama Electoral](https://www.panoramaelectoral.org/) was measuring success purely in reach, rather than the discussion and debate being generated.

However, in order to achieve their goals of fostering dialogue and increasing participation, the group shifted to collecting metrics on engagement and interaction, prompting them to see the need for a community manager to moderate the dialogue on their social media feeds.
