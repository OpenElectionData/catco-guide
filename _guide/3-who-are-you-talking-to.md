## About Your Foes

By definition, your foes will disagree with your goals, and you shouldn't spend time trying to convince them otherwise. But that doesn't mean you can ignore them.

Spend time thinking about who exactly your foes are. Maybe it's the readers of a particular publication or viewers of a specific television station. Maybe it's the leaders of the party in power. Maybe it's the leaders of the opposition party or parties. While you may not be able to change their minds and bring them on board with your goals, you will need to limit their influence and the damage they can do to you and your own goals.

Limiting the influence of foes may need to be its own goal, with strategies, tactics, resources, and audiences identified. Or you might integrate it throughout all your goals and strategies. What you decide will depend on how powerful, trusted, and pervasive your foes are. But whatever you choose, do not ignore your foes. Assume that they will be working just as hard as you - often with significantly more resources at their disposal - to communicate with your key audiences about their goals.

This is particularly important if your group is operating in a repressive environment and/or a country with closing political space. In these contexts you will need to dedicate significantly more time and resources to the issue of addressing and/ or mitigating the damage that foes can do to your ability to communicate effectively with your target audiences. Authoritarian regimes use a tremendous amount of resources to suppress, discredit, or silence credible information about elections and the findings of credible observer groups. These regimes have strong influence and, in many cases, direct or indirect control over the traditional media. Online media, including social media, may also be restricted or blocked during critical times surrounding elections. Some governments and political actors have increasingly used tools such as bots and trolls to flood citizens with disinformation \[footnote TBD: Disinformation is when false information is hared with the intent of causing harm.\] and propaganda. This includes making false accusations that election observer groups are instruments of foreign governments, creating and highlighting government-organized non-governmental organizations (GONGOs), and using “zombie” observers to produce reports claiming that flawed elections are credible. See Section 8 for more details on planning for crises and attacks from your opponents.

## Get to Know Your Target Audiences

By now, you should have a list of audiences you plan to reach. To reach them effectively, you should spend some time getting to know them.

Here are three questions you'll want to research about all your target audiences. The answers to these questions will help you determine effective messages, messengers, and platforms later on.

1\. **Where are they?** This refers to where they are both geographically and online. If your influencers are all in the capital, it doesn't make sense to buy ads in newspapers outside of the capital. If you're trying to reach young men ages 16-26 and they are all on Facebook but not many on Twitter, don't invest time and resources into Twitter.

2\. **What are the main ways they consume information?** Do they get it online? In print? On the radio? Are there specific websites, platforms, services, publications, TV shows, or people they trust? If your key audience listens to the same radio program at 3pm every day, you may want to buy an ad during that program. You also may not want to schedule your own event for that time.

3\. **Who influences them?** Who are the trusted messengers for your audiences? This could be a politician, celebrity, academic, journalist, or a member of their family or peer group. By identifying people who are already reaching your target audience, you may avoid having to build that audience from scratch. Think expansively and creatively here. The person that influences your target audience may not be well known to you.

## A Note About Influencers

In some cases, in order to reach a very broad audience, you might consider reaching out to a very narrow one. Those “influentials” at the top of the above audience map already have extensive networks and audiences of their own. Be sure you're not trying to replicate someone else's audience from scratch if you can reach out to them directly and tap into their audience instead. For example, if you are trying to affect change in one particular community, you may be able to identify the religious or political figure who has the most influence in that community and reach out to that one person directly, rather than trying to reach out to the entire community yourself.

## What If You Don't Know the Answers to These Questions?

If your audiences are different from you, you may not know these answers off the top of your head. Don't make assumptions or guesses! Try to research these audiences to get a strong and complete picture of them. Here are some ways you can research your target audiences. _(Note: it is probably most practical to combine audience research with messaging research; see next section.)_

- **Find data that exists.** Depending on where you're located, there may be audience data available for different websites, social media channels, newspapers, or television programs. If it's available, use it to determine what your audience is seeing and how they are seeing it.
- **Do focus groups.** Get four to eight members of your target audience in a room and ask them the questions in the “Get to Know your Audience” section. Listen to their answers, and don't argue with them. The point is not to convince them to consume information the way you hope to disseminate it, but to get a clearer picture of how best you can disseminate it to them.
- **One-on-one interviews.** Having a deep, one-on-one interview with members of your audience will allow you to explore their thoughts and ask follow up questions. Again, your goal isn't to convince them to come around to your way of doing things, but to change how you do things to conform best to what your audience is already doing.
