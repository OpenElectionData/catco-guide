By now you’ve created a strategic and thorough communications plan. You have a clear sense of what needs to happen when, how, and to whom. Now is also a good time to ensure that you’ve assessed your risks and adopted technical and operational best practices to mitigate them. In addition to consulting a trusted security trainer, you can also reference resources like the [Cybersecurity Campaign Playbook](https://www.ndi.org/publications/cybersecurity-campaign-playbook-global-edition), the [Digital First Aid Kit](https://www.digitaldefenders.org/digitalfirstaid/), the [Surveillance Self Defense Guide](https://ssd.eff.org/), and [others](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/digital-security-resources) for basic guidance on how to limit your information and communication related risks. These resources won’t cover all of your organization’s needs perfectly, but they’re a great place to start to help build out your holistic communications plan.

But what will you do when events deviate from the plan?

Inevitably, you will encounter roadblocks, mistakes, and crises. This is true of any communications plan, but especially true when doing work that might be perceived as threatening to existing power structures. Moving to more credible and democratic elections doesn’t happen without entrenched interests putting up a fight, and it can get ugly.

## Make a Plan

You won’t be able to plan for every possible crisis, but you can and should plan for the most likely ones.

Remember when we said your foes would be working just as hard -- and in most cases have significantly more resources -- to enact their own goals? This is the time to think through how they might do that. Will they put out disinformation about your organization and its goals or sources of funding? Will they come after you or your colleagues with personal attacks or smears? Will they try to flood the airwaves and social media channels with disinformation about the elections so your message can’t break through? Do your employees or supporters face the risk of arrest? Will your internet access or mobile service be restricted or suspended? Will they refuse to grant your organization and/or observers accreditation to observe? Will they threaten or take action to shut down your organization? 

Think back to previous crises or attacks on your organization or organizations similar to yours. Where did the threat come from? How was it carried out? How did the organization in crisis respond, and what worked or didn’t work about that response? 

Since you don’t know exactly what is coming your way, it’s normal for your crisis plan to be a bit vague. But try to make general outlines for how you’ll handle each type of crisis or attack. If you think it is a possibility that the government will release disinformation about your funding or leadership, for example, think through what messages will work best to combat that, what prominent people you can have lined up and ready to vouch for you, what materials you’ll need to distribute, whether you’ll need to activate your supporters to show up, etc. You can also take preemptive measures in some cases, like having a clear explanation on your website about where your funding comes from and how it is spent, if you think that is a likely line of attack. That way, you can point to the public information and you don’t look like you were hiding something or acting suspicious by putting up the information hastily in response to attacks.

In Belarus, Right To Choose (R2C) was the target of a PR campaign designed to smear the the coalition and cast doubt on its motives. A secret audio recording of the coalition’s leadership was published to a blog, edited to make it sound like the coalition was trying to harm the election. Luckily, the audio was first published early in the day and was not picked up by other media outlets until the evening, so R2C had a day to prepare its response and wait to see if the story broke through and gained traction. With the day to prepare, the group quickly came together and was able to have a statement ready that emphasized the false nature of the recording and the international observation protocols to which the group adheres. 

The recording would have been a lot harder to combat if it had gone immediately to major news outlets, and underscored to the group the importance of having a plan and sample drafts prepared in order to respond quickly and forcefully should something similar happen in the future.
