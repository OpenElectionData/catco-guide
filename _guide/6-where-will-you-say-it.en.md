There are dozens of ways of communicating with people, and all have their own pros and cons. Print media reaches a large audience, but the message cannot be tailored to specific audiences. It also tends to skew toward an older and literate audience. Radio is a great option for reaching people with low literacy, but the audience must fall within broadcasting range. Broadcast media (TV) reaches large audiences, but it may be difficult to get coverage, advertisements may be expensive, or the gatekeepers might be hostile to your cause. Social media allows for one-on-one interactions and wider discussions, but skews younger and for those with internet access or smartphones. Door-to-door contact can be individually targeted and highly persuasive, but it is time consuming and may be viewed with suspicion in some neighborhoods or contexts.

Depending on your goals and audiences, some tools and platforms are better than others, and their strengths and weaknesses are important to take into account when planning how you’ll deliver your messages. Whatever you choose, be sure it will reach your target audiences with maximum impact.

## Website 

Your organizational website is the place that interested people will come looking for information about your mission, work, activities, and how they can get involved to support your cause. Your website is often the way you present your organization to the digital world, and it should be designed and maintained with that in mind.

People arriving at your website should have an immediate sense of both the work of the organization and its “personality”. Is the organization tech-focused? Focused on people? Serious or humorous? Experts or novices? All of these answers will be reflected in both the design and content of the site.

If you’re organization does not currently have a website, the following are initial steps and ideas to consider:

* **What do you need your website to convey and to whom?** Most people will spend less than 10 seconds on your website -- what do you want them to learn or do in that 10 seconds? Make the most important or most requested information easy to find and access. For example, if you are trying to boost your credibility or make your expertise clear, how will you present yourself as professionals and experts in both the design and content you choose to present? 
* **Look at websites of similar groups** -- in your country or abroad. What do you like and dislike about those sites? What does the design and content say about their values, work, and mission? How can you tell that they are credible experts? What content do they prioritize and what do they make hard to find? 
* **Look at other popular websites from fields unrelated to yours**. Civil society organizations can learn a lot by studying the ways that business or media sites are set up -- groups with more resources that spend a lot of time and effort examining usage analytics and honing their websites in response. Ask yourself those same questions about the other sites -- what do you like and dislike? How do the design and content work together to convey values, work, and mission? How do they lay out their information so it’s easy to access and draws in the audience so they spend more time on the site?
* **Design your website based on what you know about your target audiences and what you learned from researching other websites.** Websites can range from the very simple to the very complex. There is no single best practice for websites; instead the complexity, look, feel, and function should all be decided based on who you are trying to reach and what you want to say to them. If you decide that you need a simple landing page without much more than a mission statement and a mechanism to collect emails, you can likely design that yourself using any number of free or cheap tools. If you need a very complex site with lots of information, multimedia integration, and complex logic, you may need to hire an experienced web developer.
* **Consider the security and sustainability of your website.** Consult with technical professionals to ensure you are making website design and development decisions that will allow your organization to maintain the availability and integrity of its site. A website that is hacked, taken down, or poorly maintained can have a negative impact on your organization and its reputation. Even if you are working with an external web developer for the initial build of your website, it is important to ensure that it is designed in a way that your organization can maintain over time and that you have an in-house technical expert(s) who can be responsible for updating the website after it is completed. Your organization should ensure that any decisions taken about the level of complexity, programming language and/or platform to use for web development is one that these in-house experts will be able to easily utilize to make any needed modifications or updates after the site is delivered.

If your organization already has a website, you should still review if its design and content meets your goals. This includes:

* **Evaluate it critically.** Does the homepage immediately convey the most important information? Do the design elements reflect your current branding and convey the tone and personality of your organization? Is the site’s messaging aligned with your frame and topline message? Is it easy to find the information most critical to your audiences? Has the website been updated with the most recent statements, photos, and content? How does your site look when accessed in the ways your audience is most likely to access it (i.e. mobile or desktop, internet speed, etc.)? Do all the links work? Are other design elements wonky or broken? Is it accessible to those with visual or hearing impairments? 
* **Protect your website from trolls, viruses, hackers, or other harmful actors.** Make sure your site has a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate to encrypt any data sent and received by users to your site (such as personal details submitted via contact forms or credit card information, if you accept payments to your site). If you are concerned about adversaries taking down your website via a distributed denial of service attack (DDOS), consider setting up advanced protection through products such as Cloudflare or Google’s Project Shield. 
* **Look at your Google Analytics.** (See next section if you have not yet set up Google Analytics on your website). How are people traveling through the site? What pages are most popular and does that match with the content you want to prioritize? What pages are people exiting the site from most often? How long are people staying on the site? What kind of devices or internet browsers are they using to access your site?
* **Make adjustments as needed**. After examining all the data and answering the questions posed above, you may find that you only need to make just a few minor changes to your site to ensure it is accomplishing your goals. Or, you may need to make substantial changes or redesign it altogether. That can feel daunting, but if your website does not reflect your mission and isn’t set up to help you achieve your goals, it is worth the time and effort to correct it.

**Ensure that your website adheres to the EU General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) and any other such international requirements that are in effect.**
