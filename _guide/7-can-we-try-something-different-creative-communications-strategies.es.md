La política y las elecciones son algo serio. Buscar el progreso democrático frecuentemente involucrará grandes riesgos, amenazas y hasta peligros para su organización y — en algunos casos — para su propia seguridad personal. Pero que los temas y consecuencias de su trabajo sean serios no significa que deban ser densos o aburridos.

En general, a la gente no le gusta ser sermoneada o que se le recuerde lo mal que están las cosas. Prefieren reírse y divertirse. Si puede usar el humor, el entretenimiento, la cultura popular o la experiencia en primera persona como una forma de entregar información importante y seria, tendrá una mejor oportunidad de que se le escuche y será más probable que sus públicos retengan la información que está intentando impartir.

## Aproveche el poder del arte y la cultura popular

La cultura popular constantemente nos enseña qué valora nuestra sociedad y cuál es nuestro papel en ella. A veces esta cultura se ocupa explícitamente de la política y a veces es más sutil a la hora de comentarla, así como a la ética y los valores que compartimos o a los que aspiramos. Pero además de su capacidad de enseñarnos, el poder real de la cultura popular radica en la parte popular. Por definición, los públicos masivos la están consumiendo. Si logra aprovechar las narrativas de la cultura popular — y aún mejor si puede ayudar a configurarlas — estará comunicándose de modo relevante con públicos más amplios.

Es realmente difícil inspirar a la gente a que trabaje a favor del cambio cuando no puede imaginar cómo sería ese cambio o cuál su resultado. La gente tal vez no imagine adecuadamente cómo podría cambiar su vida si su gobierno rindiera más cuentas, especialmente en sociedades cerradas y allí donde la democracia es nueva, transicional, frágil, o la tradición democrática es nueva. Integrar estrategias de cultura popular a sus campañas de comunicación podría ser una forma eficaz de mostrar y enseñar sus valores en acción, o de responder a las narrativas comunes que podrían dañar o debilitar su causa. Las imágenes, letras de canciones y diálogos debieran armarse para que presenten las mejores condiciones que el cambio podría traer, y no solo concentrarse en presentar los males actuales.

## ¿Qué es una campaña cultural?

Hay varias formas de integrar estrategias de la cultura pop a su plan de comunicaciones. Recuerde que en muchos casos la cultura popular es transnacional y podría reclutar figuras fuera de sus fronteras para que le asistan en sus esfuerzos, lo que es particularmente importante en sociedades cerradas.

* Alabe o difunda ampliamente toda narrativa o tendencia positiva que vea en las artes o la cultura pop, que reflejen sus mensajes.
* Corrija o responda a toda narrativa o tendencia nociva o negativa en las artes o la cultura pop, que mine el potencial para el avance democrático.
* Trabaje directamente con artistas, escritores, actores y otros creadores para que ayuden a configurar narrativas que refuercen su marco y narrativa durante la fase de producción.
* Comprometa a su público trazando conexiones de la vida real con el arte o la cultura que les gusta, o dándoles formas de canalizar su pasión a una acción en el mundo real.
* Pida a los músicos que escriban canciones para su campaña, a los cineastas que hagan videos breves, a los actores que actúen en un aviso o video, a los artistas que creen afiches o grafiti, etc.
* Haga que celebridades se unan a su campaña como voceros o mensajeros confiables, y reclútelos para que amplifiquen su mensaje mediante sus actuaciones y presencia en las redes sociales.
* Invite al público a que publique o le envíe contribuciones de la cultura popular que se sumen a sus esfuerzos.

Al igual que en el caso de sus demás estrategias, toda estrategia y táctica de cultura pop que siga debiera estar al servicio de sus metas más grandes. Si recluta a una celebridad para que sea su vocero pero esta no es popular con los públicos claves o no está dispuesta a atenerse al mensaje, entonces no valdrá la pena. Sin embargo, si la gente se hace cada vez más cínica con respecto a la democracia porque las películas y los programas televisivos dominantes muestran todos elecciones arregladas y a los políticos como corruptos, entonces podría valer la pena que trabaje con artistas y actores para crear contranarrativas que enfaticen los beneficios de la participación y la importancia de votar. Invitar al público a que publique o le envíen contribuciones de la cultura popular a sus campañas podría también ayudar a contrarrestar el cinismo, pero tendrá que filtrar los troles y otros actores malignos que podrían intentar sabotear tales esfuerzos. Esto reforzará su marco y sentará unas bases que harán que el resto de su trabajo sea más fácil.

### Su turno: La politica y la cultura popular

**Spend some time brainstorming the country's most popular television shows, movies, books, music, and celebrities. Looking at this list, ask yourself the following questions:**

{% textarea label="Do any of these explicitly deal with politics? If so, what are they saying about it?" id="culture1" size="large" button="false" %}

{% textarea label="For those that aren't dealing with politics, what are the dominant narratives? What values or morals do they impart? What ideas do they take for granted or reinforce? What frame are they operating within?" id="culture2" size="large" button="false" % }

{% textarea label="Of the narratives and values you identified, which reinforce your frame and message, and which contradict or undermine it?" id="culture3" size="large" button="false" %}

{% textarea label="Is there anything or anyone on the list of pop culture that is particularly appealing to your target audiences?" id="culture4" size="large" button="false" %}

**For the narratives that reinforce your message and frame -- especially the ones popular with your target audiences -- how can you amplify and engage with those parts of pop culture? Can you tie your work and message to the pop culture modalities? Can you engage authentically with fans about the real-world counterparts or impact? Can you recruit the stars or spokespeople to join your campaign or collaborate with you in some way?**

**For the narratives that contradict or devalue your message and frame, think about how you can present counter narratives or rebuttals to what is harmful. Can you work directly with the creators to change how your issues are presented within the culture? Can you recruit the actors or artists involved to serve as spokespeople for your cause to debunk some of the harmful messages in their work? Can you parody or play with the original narrative to present your side or ideas instead?**

## Tips for Collaborating with Artists and Fans

Working in politics or for an NGO means you may have limited exposure to artists and other creative people. Here are tips for productive and mutually beneficial relationships with them:

* **Let the artists do the art.** An artist's job is to be professionally creative, and you should give them the space to do so. Don't try to tell them how to do their jobs. Let them pitch ideas of how their talents might be best used. If an idea sounds weird or out there at first, hear them out -- just because it feels uncomfortable or different from how you have done things before doesn't mean it is a bad idea. Don't try to rein them in or change their vision unless absolutely necessary.
* **An artist's time is valuable.** Artists and other creatives are paid professionals; don't assume they will volunteer their services. Be prepared to offer and pay them at their market rate. If you can't afford to pay them, ask them if they will volunteer their services or offer a reduced rate but understand this is a lot to ask for and treat their time with value and respect even if you are not paying for it directly.
* **Collaborate, don't dictate.** You're each bringing different knowledge bases to the table. Form a collaborative partnership where you're lifting up each other's work, not trying to make it fit into your preconceived ideas.

One example is when _Black Panther_ (a popular superhero movie which takes place in the mythical African nation of Wakanda) fans organized a “Wakanda The Vote” campaign to register people attending _Black Panther_ film screenings to vote. The idea was not just to watch a screening about a fictional country built on the power of black people, but to simultaneously build black power in the real world.

{% callout title="Using Humor and the Arts to Convey a Message" %} In Malaysia, [BERSIH 2.0](http://www.bersih.org/) experimented with a number of arts and culture tactics to get the public interested and engaged on the topic of redistricting. They presented film screenings followed by discussion sessions. They organized a series of concerts to raise awareness of the issue. They also organized a standup comedy show and encouraged the comics to use material about BERSIH 2.0 and the issues - even if it meant poking fun at the issues and the organization - in an effort to teach through laughter. The comedy show proved to be so popular they extended its run - it ended up running for 10 days, and 300-400 people came to each show. {% endcallout %}

If you plan to communicate with fan communities, here are some practical tips to keep in mind:

* **Be a fan.** If you want to talk to fan communities about a movie, TV show, book, or musician, be a fan! Fans are fiercely loyal and passionate about the object of their adoration -- don't start by criticizing or pointing out the shortcomings, but approach from a place of authentic admiration.
* **Listen.** Spend some time listening to the fans, how they interact, what their internal references and jokes are, and what they love about the thing they're a fan of. It's okay to lurk online or at events for a while, just listening to get a sense for the tone and topics to use once you're ready to engage.

**Have authentic interactions.** Don't always try to wedge in your talking points or web address. Interact authentically and have real conversations with fans -- pivot to your message when it feels natural.

## The Power of Comedy

#### _This section is largely based on the work and findings of Caty Borum Chattoo's research and report_ [_The Laughter Effect_](http://cmsimpact.org/program/comedy/ "http://cmsimpact.org/program/comedy/")_._

Using humor and comedy in your communications can help your message break through and stick -- even when the issues themselves aren't lighthearted or humorous.

There are a couple of messaging pitfalls that comedy can help overcome: messages that are over-complicated, and messages that are dire or hopeless. Sometimes democracy issues can be hard to understand and the details are often very specialized and technical -- for example, the importance of reforming an electoral code. It might make the difference between credible elections or not -- but once you start talking about the legal framework, people may get bored and stop listening to you. There is also the danger that, especially in closing spaces, the situations you are addressing feel dire and hopeless -- there is nothing but bad news. When people feel hopeless they are again likely to stop listening to you. They don't want to be reminded that things are bad, and the path forward is arduous.

The power of comedy is in humanizing issues and generating positive emotions about something that might otherwise seem dull, overly complicated, or hopeless.

Research shows that people take seriously the information they learn through comedy. By introducing a topic and information through humor, people's minds are more open and ready to absorb otherwise challenging or complicated information. Comedians are often trusted messengers because they are seen as telling the truth or poking fun at power structures. This makes comedy an effective strategy for getting people to learn, care about, and take action on issues that might otherwise seem overly complicated, dull, or pessimistic.

There are, of course, times when a light-hearted or humorous approach is inappropriate. But this approach is overlooked often and is so effective that it should at least be considered and integrated when appropriate.

## The Format of Your Comedy Matters

There are a number of ways to introduce humor into your communications, and each serves a different purpose and conveys different cues about your message. It's not enough to decide you want to integrate humor into your messaging -- think carefully about what kind of humor is appropriate for the context and best serves your purposes.

* **Satirical news.** Satirical news points out and reframes absurdity. For it to work, your audience must have some basic familiarity with the situation being satirized, or they will not understand it or find it funny. Satire is good for motivating the base of people who already agree with you, but is likely to alienate or turn off people who don't agree with you.
* **Scripted, comedic storytelling.** Funny scripted stories -- TV shows, public service announcements (PSAs), movies, online videos, etc. -- are great for creating relationships between the viewers and your characters. This understanding or empathy can help normalize unfamiliar experiences and expose the viewer to people or situations they might not otherwise encounter.
* **Humorous ads.** Making someone laugh in a short amount of time captures their attention and sticks in their memory. Humorous ads -- print, online, televised, or radio -- work to quickly grab your attention and can be very memorable. They can also spark discussion and sharing with friends and family.
* **Stand up comedy and sketch comedy.** This form of comedy can introduce longer topics, help people critically evaluate them, and break taboos.

Comedy works best when people like or trust the comedian. Choose your messenger wisely for maximum impact. Your comedy should also be funny (this sounds obvious but is surprisingly hard to do). Partnering with a professional or experienced comedian can help you be sure you're funny and therefore successful.

## How Comedy Works

There are five main ways comedy works to influence your audience:

### YOUR TURN: Topline Messages

**Look back at your topline and related messages in your communications plan. Are there any messages or concepts that are difficult to explain, overly complicated, dull, or very dire and hopeless?**

**If so, brainstorm ways humor might help you better convey those messages. Here are some questions to get you started:**

{% textarea label="Are there common experiences that are able to be parodied or satorized?" id="humor1" size="small" button="false" %}

{% textarea label="Is there an absurd or ridiculous news event you can satorize in a way that reinforces your message?" id="humor2" size="small" button="false" %}

{% textarea label="Is there a well-known expression or idiom that can be changed for your purposes?" id="humor3" size="small" button="false" %}

{% textarea label="What issue or aspect of your work do you often have the hardest time explaining? Is there a funny way to approach it or a funny outcome you could use to better explain it?" id="humor4" size="small" button="false" %}

{% textarea label="Are there any comedians or comedic actors you can work with?" id="humor5" size="small" button="false" %}

## Experiential Learning and Communications

Experiential learning is the process of experiencing something new and then reflecting on that experience to come to new knowledge or larger lessons. It is commonly used in the classroom or in job training programs, and used creatively, the same principles can be applied to a communications campaign.

In some cases, your audience will undergo a new experience themselves, and you can help enrich the reflection stage of the experience so they learn new lessons. For example, if people are showing up at the polls and there is only one candidate on the ballot (or only one viable candidate), they may vote for that one candidate (the experience) and not think much of it because there's only ever been one candidate on the ballot (no reflection). Instead, you can aim your communications to interact with that voter shortly before or after their experience voting to add context and encourage reflection on their experience. Why was there only one candidate on the ballot? Can you have a credible election without choice? How would the country be different with a real choice at the ballot?

This type of communication can occur on any of the platforms or formats already discussed. For example, you might host a Facebook Live shortly after the election in which you pose questions to the audience aimed at causing reflection and ask them to contribute their thoughts and reactions about their experience in registering to vote. You could run newspaper or digital ads aimed at provoking reflections on common experiences that the audiences had while voting. You could hold community forums or go canvassing door-to-door to hold in-depth conversations in which people share their experience over the course of the election period and, through guided discussion, reflect on that experience to learn larger lessons about democracy, credible elections or accountability in government.

In other cases, your audience may not undergo the experience themselves, and so you'll want to simulate it for them or otherwise create some kind of empathic connection to the experience. For example, you could create a simple first person, role-playing game that puts the user in the position of having to vote with a physical disability. At each barrier in the process, the player would have to decide what to do or how to handle it. If there are stairs to the entrance of the polling place, players would have the option of asking others to carry them up the stairs or not voting that day and going home instead. By forcing able-bodied players to make choices from the point of view of a disabled voter, the player will reflect on the importance of accessible polling places, something they may not have given much thought to in the past.

{% figure caption:"OPORA Infographic" class:"right" %} ![OPORA Infographic](/assets/images/opora_3.jpg "OPORA Infographic") {% endfigure %}

You can achieve a similar outcome with videos, virtual reality, slide decks, online quizzes, or first person essays aimed at putting the audience through an experience different from their own. Be sure to structure it in such a way that there is room for reflection about the experience to increase the chance of the audience retaining what it learns.

For either of these approaches, it's best to have immediate actions ready for someone to take, in order to channel their newfound knowledge and enthusiasm into useful action. This might mean something as simple as signing up for your email list for updates and alerts, or something more involved like protesting inaccessible polling places at the election commission -- but you want to be sure people take action based on what they've just experienced and learned.

### YOUR TURN: Audience Experiences

**Are there experiences that your audiences will have or should have that can teach valuable lessons about your work and mission? Brainstorm what those experiences could be:**

{% textarea label="1" id="experience1" size="small" button="false" %}

{% textarea label="2" id="experience2" size="small" button="false" %}

{% textarea label="3" id="experience3" size="small" button="false" %}

{% textarea label="4" id="experience4" size="small" button="false" %}

**Now for each experience, decide whether your audience is likely to experience it themselves, or will need it simulated for them in some way.**

**If they'll experience it themselves, how will you encourage them to reflect and act from the experience? If they will not experience it for themselves, what are effective ways to simulate the experience and encourage them to reflect on it?**

## Sharing People's Stories

As already discussed, using narrative is a powerful way to emotionally connect with your audience and relay the story of your work, organization, or findings. For the most part, the narrative approaches in Chapter IV are for stories that you created or sought out -- and thereby maintain careful control of the narrative.

As a related strategy, it can be very compelling to hear from different people about a range of personal experiences or stories. Collecting and curating user-generated videos or stories can show the diversity of experiences and ideas about different issues, increasing the chances that the audience will connect with one of them, and also learn to experience and empathize with different people and points of view.

This strategy can be difficult to carry out for a number of reasons. People must have an interesting or compelling story to tell. They need to feel safe -- emotionally and physically -- sharing it with you. They need to feel comfortable with the technical aspects of submitting their story (if it requires special equipment, internet bandwidth, etc.). And finally you need to have the staff capacity to vet and curate the stories as they come in -- while you want to show a range of experiences and emotions, you still want the stories to fall within your frame and reinforce your message, and at the very least not contribute to hate speech or abuse.

{% figure caption:"Protesters hold placards with caracature depicting Najib Razak, Rosmah Mansur, Jho Low. BERSIH 2.0." %}  
![Protesters hold placards with caracature depicting Najib Razak, Rosmah Mansur, Jho Low.](/assets/images/BERSIH_2-1.jpg "BERSIH 2.0"){% endfigure %}

But if you can overcome those challenges, the benefits can be great. People love to tell and listen to stories. Showing a range of personal stories can create empathy, understanding, and engagement that data, messaging, and talking points never will. This strategy also gives regular people a way to get involved and feel like their story and experiences are part of a larger community. Learning you are not alone in how you think or what you've experienced creates a powerful form of community that will strengthen people's commitment to your work and cause.

You might consider this strategy when you think a range of stories will reinforce your overall message and frame, or when a behavior or outcome would benefit from being reinforced by a person's peer group. For example, perhaps you are trying to boost voter turnout with young women or men ages 18-25. If they aren't voting because they don't perceive it as cool or worth their time, then videos, statements, and infographics from an election observation group might not be enough to convince them. However, if they can explore 100 videos of other young women men telling their personal stories of the first time they voted and how it made them feel, your audience is more likely to trust those authentic narratives. They'll want to belong to a community that votes, like those in the videos.

In some instances, you may want to recruit and collect the stories yourself. This is a good approach to take if you want them all to look similar aesthetically (you can control how they're filmed), or you want to solicit stories from specific people and you want to make it easy on them. The drawbacks to this approach are that you'll need enough staff time and skills to recruit the people, film or otherwise collect their story, and then edit or produce the final narrative.

Instead, you might opt to have users submit their own stories. This will result in a wider variety of stories and experiences, but they will vary in quality and you will still need staff time to ensure that the stories you display help your mission.

However you decide to solicit and collect people's stories, you'll need to think about how you plan to display them, how people will find them, and what you hope they'll do once they hear the stories. You may also need to include some kind of legal disclaimer about how and who can publish or share stories, and how they can be used.
