Once you’re deep into an election period, you will likely be extremely busy. To avoid getting overwhelmed and to prioritize what to spend your time on, it’s important to set clear goals well in advance. Spend some time creating concrete goals at the very beginning of your communications or campaign planning before an electoral or campaign process begins, and get approval and agreement from your team and leadership that these are the goals you’ll be working toward as a group.

By setting clear, well-defined goals, you’ll be better able to prioritize the tasks that help you reach them, while ignoring those that get in the way. Without clear goals from the start, you won’t know if you’ve succeeded by the end, or if you need to change course mid-stream.

You have likely already done some form of goal-setting for your organization as a whole. Communications goals can be a part of a larger organizational goal, or they can stand alone as their own goal. For example, your larger organizational goal may be to conduct a verification of the voter list and use the findings to advocate for reforms in voter registration processes. To achieve that goal, you would need a communications goal of raising awareness of the findings of the voter list verification with the media, activists, and the public to mobilize support for influencing decision makers. Your communications goals should always help you advance and achieve your organizational goals.

You also want to be sure your goals are responding to the challenges your organization and your country are facing. If you have not already done a landscape analysis, organizational risk assessment, and SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis of the specific threats or challenges facing you and your political environment, it’s a good idea to do these before setting your goals. A risk assessment is especially important if you are operating in a closed or closing space. As you set your goals, be sure to consider what risks might be heightened as a result of your work (or your changing political environment) and take steps to mitigate, avoid, or accept those risks. Keep in mind that these risks can be very diverse in nature (physical, digital, emotional, legal, etc.), so be sure to think holistically as you consider them. A great resource to start thinking about your general digital risk is [Security Planner](https://securityplanner.org/) by Jigsaw. Those in higher risk organizations in closed or closing spaces should also [seek out guidance](https://securityplanner.org/#/tool/information-for-high-risk-users) from professional security trainers or auditors.

### Your Turn: Setting Communications Goals

Brainstorm communications goals by yourself or with your team by thinking about what success would look like. Here are some questions to get you started:

* What do we want to change or improve about the country’s democratic or electoral processes? 
* Do we want to raise awareness? If so, what does that look like? 
* Do we want to expand our network of volunteers? If so, for what purpose? 
* Do we want to enhance our credibility? Do we want to question the credibility of others? 
* Do we want people to change their behavior or perceptions? 
* Do we want people to take a specific action, like reporting irregularities, registering to vote, or voting? 
* Do we want to change laws or policies? 
* What do people need to understand or be educated about?

You may have brainstormed a long list of things you hope to accomplish, but it’s important to be pragmatic about what you can realistically achieve in the time frame you have. Try to narrow down your goals to between one and five, considering the time and capacity you have. Just because some of the things you hope to accomplish may have come off the list doesn’t mean you have to give up on them forever - you can always turn your attention to them at a later date.

{% callout title="Setting Organizational Goals %} Don’t forget to include organizational development in your goals. In Nigeria, the election observation group [YIAGA AFRICA](https://www.yiaga.org/) sets goals about how they want the country’s democratic institutions to improve through youth inclusion, transparent and credible elections, fighting corruption, and increasing accountability for elected officials. But they also set goals about ensuring that YIAGA AFRICA is well known by Nigerians, international press, and donors. This ensures longevity and health of the organization itself, so it can continue its work in the long term.

## Smart Goals

Vague goals are hard to work toward, or to know when you’ve achieved them. Avoid vague or overly-broad goals by making them Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-sensitive (SMART is the English acronym). Defining concrete and specific goals will keep you focused and prevent you from feeling overwhelmed.

| Vague Goals | SMART Goals |
| --- | --- |
| Build our credibility | We will be seen as experts on election observation by being included in 25 media stories about the election leading up to election day, and having at least one credible source point to our findings as definitive. | 
| Raise awareness | Raise awareness by getting 10,000 people to visit our website and have an average reach of 100,000 people across our social media channels in the three weeks before the election. |
| Demand better elections | Organization or designated spokespeople are quoted 10 times in the media demanding specific electoral reforms. |
