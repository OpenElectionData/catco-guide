## دراسة حالة: نجوم يوتيوب يقابلون الرئيس أوباما

في منتصف ولاية الرئيس باراك أوباما الثانية، شكّلت انتخابات منتصف المدة صفارة إنذار نبّهت إلى سلوك الناخبين الشباب في المستقبل. ففي انتخابات 2014، فقدَ حزب أوباما تسعة مقاعد في مجلس الشيوخ، خاسراً بذلك سيطرته على المجلس، كما فقد 13 مقعداً في مجلس النواب. كان معدّل المشاركة في الانتخابات متدنياً بين مختلف الفئات العمرية، وبالأخص بين ناخبي جيل الألفية.  ولما كانت عين أوباما على انتخابات 2016، فقد سعى، أملاً منه في ترسيخ إنجازات عهده، إلى إشراك جماهير جيل الألفية بهدف تعزيز الشعور بالحماس، ومعدّل التصويت، والمشاركة في برنامجه السياسي.

في الواقع، شهدت انتخابات منتصف المدة لعام 2014 مشاركة 19.9% فقط من الناخبين بين 18 و29 عاماً: وهي أدنى مشاركة للشباب في خلال 40 عاماً، مع انخفاض ملحوظ بالمقارنة مع نسبة 24% الذين كانوا قد أدلوا بأصواتهم في انتخابات منتصف المدة لعام 2010. فعلم أوباما أنه إذا ما بقي هؤلاء الناخبون يشعرون بالفتور واللامبالاة، وامتنعوا عن المشاركة في انتخابات 2016 وما بعدها، فقد يشكّل هذا خطراً على العديد من إنجازاته السياساتية ويهدّد بإبطالها أو إضعافها، على غرار سياسات التغطية الصحية والهجرة.

لكن عوضاً عن التوجه إلى وسائل الإعلام نفسها التي كان قد اعتمد عليها حتى تلك المرحلة، قرّر فريق الاتصالات الخاص بأوباما مخاطبة هذا الجمهور الأصغر سناً من خلال أشخاص جديرين بالثقة وعبر منصات وقنوات تجذبهم. فقد استنتج الفريق أنّ محاولة جذب الشباب إلى المنصات والقنوات التي كان أوباما يستخدمها، أو يرتاح إليها عادةً، غير فعال. وما كان منه إلا أن أجرى مسحاً لمشهد الإعلام ووسائل التواصل الاجتماعي، وأدرك أنّ العديد من الشباب يستخدمون موقع يوتيوب. بالفعل، يتمتع نجوم يوتيوب غير المعروفين بالنسبة إلى الجمهور العريض بملايين من الشباب المشتركين بقنواتهم.

{% endfigure %}

تواصل فريق أوباما مع هانك غرين، وبيثاني موتا، وغلوزيل غرين، طالباً من كل واحد فيهم إجراء مقابلة مع الرئيس في اليوم التالي لخطاب حالة الاتحاد. وقد جرت العادة أن يعرض الرئيس رؤياه السياساتية وبرنامجه عبر وسائل الإعلام التقليدية في مثل هذه المناسبة. عوضاً عن ذلك، خصّ أوباما 15 دقيقة لكلّ من هانك غرين، من مدونة "الأخوان فلوغ" التي تحظى بأكثر من 3 ملايين متابع؛ وبيثاني موتا، شابة لديها أكثر من 10 ملايين متابع تنتج فيديوهات عن الموضة، والسفر، والجمال، والطهي؛ وغلوزيل غرين، الأميركية ذات الأصول الأفريقية التي تحظى بأكبر قدر من المتابعين على يوتيوب، والمعروفة باستخدام "أخضر الشفاه" وإنتاجها فيديوهات مضحكة يتابعها أكثر من 4 ملايين مشترك.

صحيح أنّ أياً من نجوم يوتيوب هؤلاء لم تكن لديه خبرة كبيرة (أو أي خبرة على الإطلاق) في ما يتعلق بالمواضيع السياسية، إلا أنّهم كانوا يتمتعون بخصائص مشتركة هي جذبهم لشرائح كبيرة من الجماهير التي كان الرئيس يريد مخاطبتها، كما كان لكلّ منهم أسلوب مختلف وخاص به، ومصداقية عكست ثقة متابعيهم وإيمانهم بهم.

في هذا الإطار، لضمان أن تكون المقابلات واللقاءات حقيقية وأن تعكس "العلامة التجارية" بالنسبة إلى المشتركين المنتظمين في قنوات نجوم يوتيوب، سمح لهم فريق أوباما أن يكونوا على طبيعتهم ويقودوا مجرى الحديث. انعقدت المقابلات في البيت الأبيض، لكنّ كل نجم من نجوم يوتيوب حمل معه خلفيةً عكست شخصيته وعلامته التجارية، مما جعل كل مقابلة أكثر حميمية ومختلفةً عن الأخرى. لم تخضع الأسئلة لتدقيق من فريق أوباما، وقد تضمّنت بعض الأسئلة التي طعنت في الرئيس وسياساته، بما في ذلك أسئلة عن استخدامه تكنولوجيا الطائرات بلا طيار، وضبط الأمن القائم على العنصرية، والعقوبات المفروضة على كوريا الشمالية. فضلاً عن ذلك، شهدت المقابلات بعض اللحظات المضحكة، كما حدث عندما أعطت غلوزيل الرئيس أوباما هديةً إلى "زوجته الأولى" (عوضاً عن تسميتها "السيدة الأولى"). فضلاً عن ذلك، طرح نجوم يوتيوب أسئلةً ذات طابع غير سياسي أفسحت المجال أمام لحظات من التواصل الحقيقي، كما حدث  عندما سألت بيثاني موتا الرئيس عن القدرة الخارقة التي سيختار التمتع بها لو قُدّر له ذلك. (فأجاب أوباما أنه سيختار القدرة على الطيران أو إتقان كل لغات الأرض.)

بالإضافة إلى ذلك، ناقش أوباما مع غلوزيل إرثه وسجل أعماله أثناء ولايته، فضلاً عن التحديات التي ستواجهها الولايات المتحدة في المستقبل. وقد سألته بيثاني موتا التي كانت في التاسعة عشرة من عمرها عند إجراء المقابلة عن الأسباب التي قد تدفع الشباب مثلها إلى الاهتمام بالسياسة. فتمكّن أوباما من شرح الطرق التي تُؤثّر عبرها السياسة والحكومة على حياة الشباب بشكل مباشر، قائلاً: "ما من قرار نتّخذه في حياتنا لا يتأثر بطريقة أو بأخرى بقوانينا، ونحن محظوظون لأننا نعيش في نظام ديمقراطي حيث يُعتبر صوتنا مهماً". ومع أنّ أوباما وجّه كلامه إلى بيثاني، إلا أنه كان يخاطب، في الوقت نفسه، مشتركيها العشرة ملايين الذين امتنع الكثير منهم عن الاقتراع في الانتخابات الأخيرة.

حظيت المقابلات بأكثر من 5 ملايين مشاهدة من جمهور غلب عليه جيل الألفية.

## Case Study: Telling Stories in Support of LGBTI Rights

In Nicaragua, where stigma and discrimination of LGBTI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex) people is pervasive, activists from the LBGTI community were trying to grow their political power in order to pass a nondiscrimination ordinance to protect themselves and their communities. The activists knew they didn't wield enough political power by themselves and would have to recruit a critical mass of allies and supporters from outside their community to support the ordinance if it had a chance of passing.

NDI brought together a diverse and representative group of LGBTI activists to better learn about the audience and design an effective campaign to communicate with the target audiences to persuade them to join the cause and support the anti-discrimination ordinance.

To better understand their target audiences, first the activists worked with NDI to design a nationwide study on attitudes toward LGBTI people. They wanted to identify how those audiences thought about their communities, how those attitudes came about, and what influenced them. The activists wanted a sense of what messages might work for straight audiences, instead of trying to guess or impose messages that resonated within the LGBTI communities but might not connect with those outside those communities.

{% endfigure %}

The research uncovered some interesting opportunities. A large percentage of those polled recognized LGBTI rights in the abstract, but a much smaller percentage of those people reported a willingness to act in support of those rights. Of those who did report a willingness to act in support of those rights, a very high percentage also reported having an LGBTI family member or loved one. When asked where the stigma or discrimination against LGBTI people came from, most respondents recognized it came from the Catholic Church -- the predominant faith in Nicaragua. Most of those who reported that they had LGBTI family or loved ones also reported that they were regular church-goers.

Based on these findings, the activists decided to amplify the stories and examples of straight people who had become allies to LBGTI rights because of their personal connections to LGBTI people. They hoped to humanize the issue to people who might not have a close family member or loved one who was LBGTI, and create recognition and empathy with those who did.

They also decided to use explicitly faith-based, biblical language and messaging, to provide new allies a path to reconcile their faith with support for LBGTI rights. This was not necessarily the frame or message the activists would have used to describe themselves or within their communities, but it was important to use a frame and message that their target audience was comfortable with and steeped in.

The resulting communications campaign was called “In The Lord's Vineyard.” The website, [www.enlaviñadelseñor.com](http://www.xn--enlaviadelseor-vnbg.com/), includes a library with “postcards” and video stories created to resonate with the target audience of straight people open to becoming allies for LBGTI rights.

The original postcards and videos were created by the campaign. The activists discussed and selected those they wanted to have share their stories so that they were representative of the target audiences and messages they wanted to get across. Then those people were interviewed with specific questions to shape and elicit the "journey" narratives at the heart of the campaign.

With the campaign's curated content at the heart of the site, followers and fans of the campaign could submit their own stories and photos, and a few of them were added to the website using existing templates. This dual approach of proactively seeking out specific narratives while also allowing users to submit their own allowed the campaign to control the message while remaining participatory and collaborative with the audience.

The campaign was also active on Facebook, the most popular and widely used social media platform in Nicaragua. The [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/enlavinadelsenornica/) was used to disseminate the multimedia stories to a wider audience, direct people back to the website, and interact with the audience by answering questions, receiving feedback, and connecting those who wanted to become active allies with campaign opportunities.

Several months after launching “In The Lord's Vineyard,” the group presented a nondiscrimination ordinance to the Managua City Council and Mayor's office. That was accompanied by a campaign to enlist allied businesses to establish themselves as "discrimination-free zones." To date more than 40 businesses have signed on.

While the ordinance has not yet been passed, the group continues to build support for it by targeting key audiences like businesses and straight allies with its messaging, in order to get them more involved in the issue and demonstrate wide support among different, powerful demographics.

## Case Study: Live Streaming Election Day

In Belarus, where political competition is severely restricted and political organizing can be challenged or stopped by the government, a coalition of opposition political parties came together to both observe and contest the elections. Right To Choose (R2C) engages in pollwatching for each election -- elections that are compromised in a variety of ways by the government.

R2C seeks not only to inform the public of problems with the election, but also gives evidence of unfair election practices to the candidates that are harmed. They want to both document electoral problems but also spur change in how elections are carried out, and increase the competitiveness of elections to level the playing field and ensure that more people have a fair chance of winning office.

In previous years, R2C had grown more sophisticated and skilled at its observation efforts, but communicating about those efforts and findings was stunted. The group would primarily put out a press release and hold a press conference -- too often those press conferences were long and unfocused. In addition, the media environment in Belarus is incredibly restricted -- there is simply no way that state-run print and broadcast outlets were going to report on R2C's findings. These tactics weren't able to break through and couldn't reach the mass audience required to gain momentum for change.

Every year after their observation efforts, R2C coalition members come together to assess what went right and what they can do better. Out of these discussions they came to the conclusion that their press release and press conference model was not achieving their goals. They evaluated how people were used to receiving news and how they could reach the large-scale audiences they needed. Live streaming had proved to be a popular and effective way to broadcast protests, and -- crucially -- audiences had become used to consuming news and accepting the authenticity of these live streams.

Building on this insight, the R2C team decided to center their communications strategy for the next elections on live streaming. The team set up an Election Media Center and scheduled programing throughout the day with news, analysis, candidate interviews, and streams from poll watchers in the field. They planned all their content out for the day and scripted what they could to limit dead airtime and ensure that important messages were emphasized. They partnered with TV and radio outlets that were open to their message, providing not only wider reach but a further level of professionalization and expertise. R2C invested in a multicast tool and software, which allowed them to live stream simultaneously to all the major social media platforms and professionalize transitions and the appearance of the live stream. They also hired someone with enough technical proficiency and experience to run the live stream throughout the day.

On election day, within the first 35 minutes of the media center being active, internet access was shut down by the government. The team had anticipated such a crisis and moved quickly to a second location. They were able to live stream from that second location for the rest of the day although internet access was sporadic at times.

In the lead up to election day, R2C had trained and equipped candidates and poll watchers to live stream their findings. In anticipation of equipment being confiscated or access being restricted, poll watchers were briefed not to start live streaming until something newsworthy happened -- that way the team was able to focus on live streaming election irregularities and weren't wasting their brief window of opportunity on less important content.

The live stream was watched by more than 300,000 people on election day and shared by social media influencers and media. It proved to be a much more successful approach than relying on the media itself to be the gatekeeper and disseminator of their findings.

## Case Study: Creative, Ongoing Tactics for Increased Engagement

One major challenge facing CRTA, the civic election observation group in Serbia, was the declining rates of voter participation among Serbians. Participation in voting had been declining since 2008, and by 2016 CRTA felt it was important to re-engage the public and educate them on how important it was to participate in elections and how to protect their own rights while doing so.

CRTA employed a number of strategies and a variety of channels and products to accomplish this goal, in order to reach their key audiences with messages that would resonate.

{% figure caption:"CRTA Photo." %}

{% endfigure %}

The group worked to make its messaging simple and relatable, employing common metaphors that people could relate to to make the electoral process and principles more interesting to regular people. They worked to frame statistics on why elections are important within a human context, showing how each statistic related to real people, and making infographics and short Q&As to emphasize this point.

To raise awareness of people's rights and responsibilities in the voting booth, CRTA created a series of videos with actors simulating common scenarios encountered at polling stations to show people what behaviors were violations of their rights. They re-enacted common ways that bad actors might try to control voting behavior and how to voters could protect themselves and their rights.

They also used social media to bring transparency to previously-secretive processes. They live tweeted from inside local electoral commission sessions, meetings that had previously been closed to the public, with a live report of what was being said and done. CRTA observers' live tweets from within the sessions were the public's first glimpse into the recklessness and lack of professionalism of the commissions. The live tweeting built the group's following and credibility, along with bringing increased transparency to the process. CRTA also deployed observers to the locations where ballots were printed to tweet and live stream that process, to bring light to that process and get people engaged in the elections before election day.

“You have to have content about the elections continuously,” said Jovana Djurbabic, the communications manager of CRTA. “Not just when the campaign starts, but a continuous effort on how to find ways to interest people.” By deploying different strategies and types of communications all year-round, CRTA has increased interest and engagement in the electoral process in Serbia.

## Case Study: Poking Fun at the Aging Central Election Commission

With experience monitoring elections and engaging with the Ukrainian public since 2005, OPORA has had to adapt to a changing political and social environment over time. While the group got its start observing elections in a challenging environment, more recently it has taken on a broader set of issues to work on. While the group still monitors and reports on elections -- and has become a trusted national source for doing so -- in recent years it has turned its attention to campaigns to strengthen other aspects of an emerging democracy.

One topic of attention: the need for the president to appoint a new Central Election Commission (CEC). The Central Election Commission -- the body responsible for overseeing the proper functioning of national elections -- is composed of 15 members. In June of 2014, 12 members' terms expired. In February of 2017, a 13th member's term expired. The president continued to delay the appointment of new members, and in the meantime the old members continued to sit on the commission, long past their legal term limit.

“Even though it was a serious topic, it became hard to take seriously because it was getting so ridiculous,” said Iryna Shvets, program manager of OPORA. Every month, the president put off new appointments to the commission to the next month. “‘In the nearest future' is the phrase they kept using,” Shvets recalled.

To highlight the absurdity of the situation and simultaneously drive demand for action, OPORA took a humorous approach to the problem. They launched a campaign on social media comparing the Central Election Commission to wine. “The Central Election Commission is not like wine, it isn't aging well” was their topline message. From that premise, they created a series of funny images, graphics, and other Facebook and Twitter content, like polls. They asked their followers what was likely to happen first -- a new metro line being built or the CEC being re-appointed, for example, highlighting the length of time it was taking for something comparatively easy to complete.

Shvets credits the success of this campaign to the strong and trusted brand of OPORA. “When we're communicating with MPs \[members of parliament\] or international organizations we might do a serious report,” she said. “But with the public, we can have more fun. We are a well-known organization from our election campaigns, which means we can make jokes and be creative, we don't just have to stick to one format.” For example, whenOPORA presented an analysis of electoral campaigns in conflict zones, and couldn't risk being misunderstood about the nature of the matter, they decided against employing humor

Using humor in the case of the Central Election Commission not only raised awareness of the issue with a larger audience but made an otherwise complicated or boring issue feel relevant and urgent to the public. They may not have known the details of the commission, its composition, or even its role in overseeing elections -- but they could understand and identify with a government promising something and putting it off indefinitely. The humor also quickly conveyed the concept that this should be a speedy process -- wine might age well, but this commission most certainly did not.

Ultimately the campaign contributed to a new CEC being appointed. In January of 2018, the president formally dismissed the 13 members whose term had expired and officially appointed their replacements, well ahead of 2019 presidential and parliamentary elections.

## Case Study: “Communications Is Everyone's Business”

{% figure caption:"YIAGA Africa Photo." %}

![YIAGA Africa Photo.](/assets/images/yiaga_8-1.jpg "YIAGA Africa Photo.")

{% endfigure %}

The communications team of Nigerian election observation group YIAGA AFRICA consists of five staff members: one to write and produce video and radio content, a photography editor, a web manager to update and manage the website, one person to manage the blast email and text program, and a graphic designer who works on social media and infographic content. Together, the team works to normalize and integrate more participatory practices into Nigeria's political system -- like the importance of young people running for office and the importance of registering to vote.

However, the communications team is aware of the limitations even of a five-person team. To increase the internal capacity of their organization, the communications team has trained and empowered all staff at YIAGA AFRICA to be effective communicators and offer additional support to the team when time allows.

“Communications is everyone's business,” says Moshood Isah, the communications officer of YIAGA AFRICA. “There is a communications team, but generally, everyone at the organization is responsible.”

To distribute communications knowledge and skills to all members of the staff, the communications team organizes regular trainings for the full staff. The team has conducted trainings on writing for the web, how to use hashtags and why, how to write news stories for the media, how to speak to media and stay on message, and on other aspects of communications vital to the organization's success.

For example, ahead of a PVT, the communications team knew that they would have to hold their results until after the electoral commission released the results. To ensure that that strategy was effectively carried out, the communications team trained all staff on why and how to keep the results private, and when and how to publicize them at the appropriate time.

By training the larger staff in basics of good communications practices and strategy, the team has been able to broaden its reach and influence. Non-communications staff feel comfortable contributing to the website, creating social media content, and talking to the media. The increase in capacity also frees up the communications team to do some of the higher level tasks and strategizing to allow them to plan for the future and make the organization more prevalent and effective.
