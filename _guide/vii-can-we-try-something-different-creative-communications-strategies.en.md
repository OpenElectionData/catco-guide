Politics and elections are serious business. Pushing for democratic progress often involves facing great risks, threats, and even dangers for your organization and -- in some cases -- your own personal safety. But just because the topics and consequences of your work are serious doesn’t mean they should be dense or dull.

Generally speaking, people don’t like to be lectured or reminded of how bad things are. People prefer to laugh and have fun. If you can use humor, entertainment, popular culture, or first-person experience as a way to deliver important and serious information, you’ll have a better chance of being listened to, and your audiences will be more likely to retain the information you are trying to impart.

## Harness the Power of Art and Popular Culture

Popular culture is constantly teaching us what our society values and what our role in it is. Sometimes popular culture explicitly addresses politics, and sometimes it is more subtly commenting on the politics, ethics, and values we share or aspire to. But in addition to its ability to teach us, the real power of popular culture lies in the popular part. By definition, mass audiences are consuming it. If you can tap into pop culture narratives -- and even better, if you can help shape them -- then you will be communicating relevantly with broad audiences.

It’s really hard to inspire people to work for change when they can’t imagine what that change can look like or result in. Especially in closed societies and places where democracy is new, transitional, fragile, or a democratic tradition is new, people might not be able to adequately picture how their lives might change if their government were more accountable. Integrating popular culture strategies into your communications campaigns can be an effective way to show and teach your values in action or push back against common narratives that might harm or weaken your cause. Images, lyrics, and dialogues should be crafted to present improved circumstances that change could bring and not just concentrate on exposing present ills.

## What is a Culture Campaign?

There are a number of ways to integrate pop culture strategies into your communications plan. Remember that popular culture in many instances is transnational, and you might be able to enlist figures outside your borders to assist your efforts, which is particularly important in closed societies.

* Praise or amplify positive narratives or trends you see in the arts or pop culture that reflect your messages.
* Correct or push back against negative or harmful narratives or trends in the arts or pop culture that undermine potentials for democratic progress.
* Work directly with artists, writers, actors, or other creators to help shape narratives that reinforce your frame and narrative during the production phase.
* Engage with your audience by drawing real-world connections to the art or culture they’re fans of or giving them ways to channel their passion into real-world action.
* Ask musicians to write songs for your campaign, filmmakers to produce short videos, actors to star in an ad or video, artists to create posters or grafiti, etc., for your campaign.
* Have celebrities join your campaign as spokespeople or trusted messengers, enlist them to amplify your messages through their performances and social media presence.
* Invite the public to post or submit popular culture contributions to your efforts.

As with your other strategies, any pop culture strategies and tactics you pursue should be in service to your larger goals. If you recruit a celebrity to be your spokesperson but that person is not popular with key audiences or isn’t willing to stay on message, then it’s not worth the effort. If, however, people are becoming increasingly cynical about democracy because the dominant television shows and movies all portray elections as rigged and politicians as corrupt, then you might want to work with artists and actors to create counter narratives that emphasize the benefits of participation and the importance of voting. Inviting the public to post or submit popular culture contributions to your campaigns can also help counter cynicism, while you will need to filter against trolls and other malign actors who may try to sabotage such efforts. This will reinforce your frame and lay a foundation that makes the rest of your work easier.

### Your Turn:

**Spend some time brainstorming the country’s most popular television shows, movies, books, music, and celebrities.**

**Looking at this list, ask yourself the following questions:**

{% textarea label="Do any of these explicitly deal with politics? If so, what are they saying about it?" id="culture1" size="small" button="false" %}

{% textarea label="For those that aren’t dealing with politics, what are the dominant narratives? What values or morals do they impart? What ideas do they take for granted or reinforce? What frame are they operating within?" id="culture2" size="large" button="false" %}

{% textarea label="Of the narratives and values you identified, which reinforce your frame and message, and which contradict or undermine it?" id="culture3" size="small" button="false" %}

{% textarea label="Is there anything or anyone on the list of pop culture that is particularly appealing to your target audiences?" id="culture4" size="small" button="false" %}

**For the narratives that reinforce your message and frame -- especially the ones popular with your target audiences -- how can you amplify and engage with those parts of pop culture? Can you tie your work and message to the pop culture modalities? Can you engage authentically with fans about the real-world counterparts or impact? Can you recruit the stars or spokespeople to join your campaign or collaborate with you in some way?**

**For the narratives that contradict or devalue your message and frame, think about how you can present counter narratives or rebuttals to what is harmful. Can you work directly with the creators to change how your issues are presented within the culture? Can you recruit the actors or artists involved to serve as spokespeople for your cause to debunk some of the harmful messages in their work? Can you parody or play with the original narrative to present your side or ideas instead?**
