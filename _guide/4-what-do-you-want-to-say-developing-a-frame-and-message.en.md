## Develop a Communications Frame

A communications frame is the set of values and assumptions that all of your communications take for granted. Having a clear communications frame from the outset will ensure consistency across your communications, but it will also ensure that your audiences understand where you are coming from and what you are trying to communicate to them.

For example, your frame might be that democracy is preferable to other forms of government. Other assumptions of that frame might include the ideas that citizens should be able to participate freely in the democratic process, a peaceful transfer of power is preferable to one-party rule, elections should be credible, and democratic governance should improve people’s lives.

If your audience does not share the values and assumptions of your frame, they will have a hard time understanding what you are trying to communicate to them.

Continuing the example above, if your audience rejects your frame and instead believes that one-party rule is preferable to democracy, then they will not be receptive to any narratives or messages about supporting competitive election processes. You won’t be listened to or understood.

You may need to re-adjust your frame to match that of your audience so that they are receptive to what you are trying to convey. In places where a democracy frame won’t be understood or trusted, you may need to create a communications frame around values of fairness, national strength, unity, or some other value or outlook upon which you and your audience can agree and understand each other.

### Your Turn: Develop a Communications Frame

**Brainstorm a list of basic values and assumptions that are at the core of your work and communications.**

{% textarea label="2" id="value2" size="small" button= "false" %}

{% textarea label="3" id="value3" size="small" button= "false" %}

{% textarea label="4" id="value4" size="small" button= "false" %}

**Refine these until you have a clear list of assumptions and values that will be reflected throughout your communications.**

**Now list the values and assumptions of your key target audiences to assess whether this frame truly matches the values and assumptions of each of your key audiences.**

{% textarea label="Target Audience 1" id="1" size="small" button= "false" %}

{% textarea label="Target Audience 1 Value and Assumptions" id="1" size="large" button= "false" %}

{% textarea label="Target Audience 2" id="2" size="small" button= "false" %}

{% textarea label="Target Audience 2 Value and Assumptions" id="2" size="large" button= "false" %}

{% textarea label="Target Audience 3" id="3" size="small" button= "false" %}

{% textarea label="Target Audience 3 Value and Assumptions" id="3" size="large" button= "false" %}

{% textarea label="Target Audience 4" id="4" size="small" button= "false" %}

{% textarea label="Target Audience 4 Value and Assumptions" id="4" size="large" button= "false" %}

**Compare the values and assumptions at the core of your work with those of your audiences. Are they similar? If not, how can you adjust your frame to be understood by them without abandoning your values and principles?**

Once you have settled on a clear frame, it’s important to ensure that all your communications fit within it. Share it with all the members of your team, spokespeople, leaders, board members, etc. Check all outgoing communications against the frame to ensure consistency. If you create communications that are inconsistent with your frame, your audiences will be confused and your messages will be muddled. People need to know what your underlying values are and what to expect from your organization.

For example, if your frame is that democracy is preferable to all other forms of government, elections should be competitive, and that the will of the people must be respected, but you issue a press release implying that a certain candidate should pull out of the race, your audience will become confused, you will lose credibility, and your subsequent messaging will be inconsistent or contradictory.

## Develop Your Topline Message

Now that you’re clear on your frame, it’s time to start developing your topline message. This is the distillation of the key point(s) you want to get across in all your communications. Whereas a frame is a place of common understanding between you and your audience, your topline message is what you want your audience to learn and have reinforced every time they hear from you.

Continuing with our example, if your goal is to raise awareness of your PVT and your frame is that democracy is preferable to all other forms of government, you topline message might be:

**A PVT independently verifies whether official election results are accurate, because every vote should be counted and every voice should be heard.**

## What Makes for a Good Topline Message?

The message in the example above is:

* Short
* Clear
* Teaches the audience something it might not know
* Embedded with values and emotion meant to connect with the audience

If the topline message were only “a PVT independently verifies that official election results are accurate, which deters fraud,” it would teach the audience about a PVT, but would lack an emotional way for the audience to connect. If the message were only “we must ensure every vote is counted,” it might resonate emotionally with the audience but not meet the goal of raising awareness of what a PVT is or does.

{% callout title="Focusing on One Message" %} [Civil Network OPORA](https://www.oporaua.org/en) is a citizen group in Ukraine that has been observing elections and calling for stronger democratic institutions for more than a decade. One thing they’ve learned in that time is to choose one message and stick to it for the duration of a campaign. “If you present dozens of issues or messages at a time, you’re not going to get people to focus,” said Iryna Shvets, OPORA’s program manager. Instead, OPORA will choose one focused message and push it out exclusively for at least two months, or until the group feels like it has broken through with their audience.

While the group was conducting a campaign to pressure the government to appoint new members to the Central Election Commission, its central message was that the commission had overstayed its term and needed to be updated as soon as possible. They drove the message in all their external communications until new commissioners were appointed. (See Case Studies section for more information on the campaign). {% endcallout %}

### Your Turn: Create Your Topline Message

**Start by brainstorming all of the possible things you might want to say. Don’t hold back! Some might be sentences, some might just be words. Here are some questions to get you started brainstorming:**

**● Someone asks you what your organization is all about. How do you answer?**

**● What’s your favorite argument in favor of your cause or organization?**

**● What inspired you to take action for this issue?**

**● Who does your work help? How does it help them?**

**● What values do you uphold in your work?**

**● What will happen if your mission fails?**

**● What keeps you advocating for this cause every day?**

**Now, you are probably looking at a big mess of words. By using different colored pens or by rewriting them on different pieces of paper, start sorting the words and phrases into groups that are similar by theme or tone.**

**Keep narrowing down and honing each group. Which words or themes keep coming up? Which ones are the most persuasive? The most inspiring? The most emotional?**

**Take the most persuasive phrases and words and craft them into one or two sentences. That’s your topline message.**

**Go back and look at your goals -- make sure this message supports your overall goals.**

## Different Messages Resonate with Different Audiences

Your topline message should be clear, concise, persuasive, and support your goals and frame. However, different people may respond differently to your message, and you may need to adapt or adjust it depending on who you are communicating with.

This can mean changing the tone or vocabulary you use, or it can mean reshaping the main message to emphasize the values or emotions that will connect with a particular audience. The resulting messages shouldn’t contradict your frame or topline message, but they should resonate with the different subsets of audiences you identified so you are more easily able to connect and communicate with them.

Example:

| Goal | Top Line Message | Target Audience | Target Message |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Raise awareness of what a PVT is by having 10,000 people visit our website and having an average reach of 100,000 people across our social media channels in the three weeks before the election.  | A PVT independently verifies whether official election results are accurate, because every vote should be counted and every voice should be heard. | Journalists who write about elections
Members of the party in power 
Members of the opposition party
 | **A PVT is a statistically rigorous and internationally accepted practice to assess the accuracy or fraudulence of official election results. The results of the PVT will help tell the story of the election by providing another data set against which to verify official election results.** 
 
A PVT verifies that announced election results are accurate. Win or lose, great leaders respect the will of the people when every vote is counted and every voice is heard. 


A PVT verifies that true results are known; that deters fraud, which ensures all votes are accurately counted and the true winner is known. |
