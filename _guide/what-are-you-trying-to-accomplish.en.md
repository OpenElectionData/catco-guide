In general, if you mapped the public at the beginning of your communications campaign, it would look like the below graphic.

{% figure caption:"Chart adapted from Ed Grefe's lectures as an adjunct professor at George Washington University." class:"center" %} ![](/assets/images/bell_chart_eng.png)
{% endfigure %}

Your "friends" are the 5-10 percent of the public that already support your cause, believe you are a credible organization, will show up when asked, will share your message, etc. You do not need to convince them of the importance of your cause.

Your "foes" are the 5-10 percent of the public that will always disagree with your cause, no matter what you say or how you try to convince them. It's not worth spending time trying to convince them otherwise, but you will want to limit the amount of negative influence they have on you and your issue.

(The percentage of the population you can trust can count as friends or foes will vary - sometimes significantly - depending on the country, political context, and issue. This chart is meant to be a starting point for mapping out your audiences.)

The biggest space in the middle, usually 80-90 percent of the public, are "strangers." They don't know about your organization or issue and so haven't formed an opinion one way or the other.  these people can be further divided into "influentials" - the media, political operatives and leaders, government officials, civic activists, academics, and business and community leaders who help other form opinions - and the general public.

Broadly speaking, every communications campaign is trying to move more and more people from the middle of the above "audience map" graph into the "friends and family" portion of it, effectively moving that vertical line on the left toward the right, while keeping your "foes" line from moving.

But the "general public" is large and varied, and with limited time and resources you'll need to specify exactly who you want to talk to and prioritize those groups that will help you achieve your overall goals.

To help you decide which segments of the general public to prioritize, it can be helpful to think about communicating with an intent to change behavior or change perceptions. First, ask yourself whose behavior or perceptions you need to change - these are your priority stakeholder groups. Then think about the relationships between your identified stakeholder groups.  If you succeed in changing the behavior or perceptions of one group first, would this affect how other priority stakeholder groups behave or view the issue? If so, this stakeholder group belongs to the "influentials" category of your audience map and should be a high priority for outreach.

{% callout title="Targeting the Right Audiences" %} "Audiences depend on the campaign," said Iryna Shvets, program manager of Civil Network OPORA, a citizen observer group in Ukraine. "We are never targeting the 'general public.'" The group may end up educating members of the general public as a side-effect of more targeted communications, but it is too broad and vast an audience to try to target in and of itself. Instead, they focus on key stakeholders and decision makers for a particular campaign or lobbying effort. For example, if they want to push for changes to law or norms to align them with international standards, they'll target Members of Parliament or international organizations that believe will support international norms for democratic elections.  {% endcallout %}

### Your Turn: Identify Your Audience

Let's continue with our example to see how this works:

By selecting these audiences, we're hoping to raise awareness and understanding of the PVT with the influencers who will need to understand, accept, and share the findings of the PVT and with the people most likely to resort to election-related violence. We also want to empower the people who already understand PVTs with the ability to talk about and share this information with their own friends, as they'll be seen as trusted messengers in their own networks. These are the audiences we believe we need to reach to achieve our goal of raising awareness through web traffic and social media.

| Target Audiences | Strategies |
| :--- | :--- |
| - Journalists who write about elections<br>- Members of the party in power<br>- Members of the opposition party/parties<br> | Strategy 1: Use digital advertising to generate web trafiic and social reach. |
| Young men ages 16-26 | Strategy 2: Have a celebrity or influential person share our content on social media and direct people to the website. |
| Exisiting members (aka our "friends") and their social networks | Strategy 3: Use our email list to encourage peer-to-peer social sharing. |

**Look at your goals, strategies and tactics from the last exercise. Who is/are the best audience/s for each one? Who do you need to reach to be successful and why?
You may need to change or refine your tactics as you get a clearer picture of who your audience is. Who's missing?**

### Target Audiences

### Strategies

### Tactics

**Look at all the audiences you plan to target with your strategies and tactics. Is there a key audience or group you aren't speaking to with any of your goals, strategies or tactics? You may need to add a goal, strategy or set of tactics to ensure that you are reaching a key audience you inadvertently left out.**

**For example, let's say you've gotten this far but none of your strategies involve reaching the audience of the political party in power - even though they will be an important group to accept the legitimacy of the PVT findings. Revisit your goals, strategies and tactics to think about how you'll talk to them and what you hope to accomplish when you do.**

## About Your Foes

By definition, your foes will disagree with your goals, and you shouldn't spend time trying to convince them otherwise. But that doesn't mean you can ignore them.

Spend time thinking about who exactly your foes are. Maybe it's the readers of a particular publication or viewers of a specific television station. Maybe it's the leaders of the party in power. Maybe it's the leaders of the opposition party or parties. While you may not be able to change their minds and bring them on board with your goals, you will need to limit their influence and the damage they can do to you and your own goals.

Limiting the influence of foes may need to be its own goal, with strategies, tactics, resources, and audiences identified. Or you might integrate it throughout all your goals and strategies. What you decide will depend on how powerful, trusted, and pervasive your foes are. But whatever you choose, do not ignore your foes.  Assume that they will be working just as hard as you - often with significantly more resources at their disposal - to communicate with your key audiences about their goals.
