  and case studies for civil society groups operating in repressive environments.
purpose_title: Purpose of this Guide
purpose_desc: "<p>Nonpartisan citizen election observation groups and civil society
  organizations (CSOs) work hard every day organizing citizens, collecting and analyzing
  data, and making the case for democratic reforms. In closed environments, they also
  must push back against infringements by authoritarian power structures. Authoritarians
  have taken steps to block, muffle, or discredit these groups and their findings.
  This guide is intended to provide best practices for organizational communication
  in places of closing political space.</p> <p>While the guide is mainly focused on
  election observation groups, the principles of communication are applicable to any
  number of causes and contexts. CSOs that work on issues other than electoral integrity
  can use this guide to create impactful communications plans that spur action on
  the issues they care about. International practitioners can use this guide and the
  process it lays out to develop effective trainings and provide technical assistance
  to groups that want to strengthen their communications and outreach.</p>"
how_to_use_title: How to Use this Guide
how_to_use_desc: "<p>This guide offers a step-by-step approach to strategic communications
  planning and programming, starting with defining goals and ending with establishing
  a division of labor. Each chapter introduces a new concept and component in the
  strategic communications planning process. The chapters build on each other, and
  each new chapter relies on the information and work that came before it.</p> <p>The
  guide is structured to be used as a workbook or to guide a group planning process.
  Practical exercises throughout each chapter will allow you and your team to immediately
  apply the concepts to your own strategic plan. There are hypothetical and real-world
  examples included in each chapter to illustrate how the concepts and ideas can be
  used, and case studies at the end to give you a sense of what others are doing and
  what is possible.</p>"
