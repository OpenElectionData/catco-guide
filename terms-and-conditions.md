## Site Usage Information

Users do not need to register to use many features of this NDI website.

For features that require personal data, the user must provide accurate, true and complete information. By providing this information to NDI, you consent to NDI's use of your information in accordance with the terms outlined in the privacy policy as well as these terms and conditions.

For instance, the web server may record the numerical Internet Protocol address of your computer; information about your browser and operating system; date and time of access; and the Internet address and page that linked (referred) you to our site. If you search the site, your search requests may be logged. NDI uses this information to measure the number of visitors to different sections of the site, diagnose and correct system errors, and conduct research — all with the sole objective of improving the information service, features and usability of the site.

## Cookie Policy

NDI websites use web cookies — small data files that are placed on the user's device by which a website and a web browser can jointly “remember” information within or between browsing sessions. Cookies are useful because they can improve the user experience. However, cookies also have been subject to criticism because they can be used to invisibly assemble information about a user's browsing habits for marketing purposes.

NDI uses cookies to improve the user experience within the context of a single browser session or between site visits. Cookies may contain a “key” so that users do not need to login every time a new page is visited, or when returning to the NDI website from the same computer at a later date.

to analyse use of the site by, for example, recognizing and counting the number of visitors and how they move around the site.This helps NDI to see what parts of our site are popular and which sections may need improving to make the experience better for users; and

## NDI Partner Websites and Links to Independent Websites

As part of its democracy support efforts, NDI often assists its partners around the world with developing websites. Examples may include a national parliament website that provides legislative information to the public, or an NGO or advocacy group site that shares details about its work in the community. This NDI privacy policy does not apply to such websites that are developed and maintained by NDI partners. These partners develop and maintain their own privacy policies for information collected on their websites. It is NDI policy never to take possession of or use personal information provided to partners through these websites and NDI does not share personal data obtained via NDI's websites with the websites of partner organizations.

NDI websites may also contain pages with links to independent, external websites for which the Institute is not responsible.

## NDI Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data integrity and preserve important content, NDI has established appropriate physical, electronic and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure information collected online. The information NDI collects about website users is stored on secure servers that are built to industry best practices and have undergone rigorous security testing. All sensitive information submitted to NDI servers is encrypted over HTTPS using current standard TLS protocols. NDI's servers are professionally maintained and updated, routinely audited and constantly monitored. All NDI servers are shielded behind an enterprise-grade content distribution network (CDN) for protection against distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks and certain forms of hacking.
